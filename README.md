# combat-script

Combat Script is a toy programming language designed to be simple and easy to use. It has only 8 keywords, including "if", "and", "or", "else", "break", "event", "fire", and "while", as well as a "print" keyword for outputting text or variables to the console. The language is intended for simple scripting tasks and is not meant for advanced projects. Its minimalistic design makes it easy for beginners to learn and use.

It also comes with some built-in functions such as "value()" and "string()".

## Reserved Keywords ##
* print   - prints text to console
* if      - runs a conditional statement in the code
* else    - is used in conjunction with "if" to specify an alternative code block to be executed if the first condition is not met.
* or, and - are logical operators used to combine conditions in boolean expressions.
* break   - is used to exit a loop or a switch statement.
* event   - is used to define an event that can be triggered in the code
* fire    - triggers an event in the code
* while   - is used to create a loop that executes as long as a certain condition is true.

## Built-in functions ##
* prompt  - prompts user for an input
* value   - turns a string for example a prompt into an integer
* string  - we all know what this does

Note: Do not try to use this language for advanced projects like, making 3d games or stuff like that. It is only a toy.
